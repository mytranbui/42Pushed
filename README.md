### Piscine Reloaded
A serie of exercises done during the piscine to remind you all the basics of the C programming language.

### Get_next_line
A function that reads a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor
key points learned:
- static variables
- deeper understanding of allocations, what is happening ine the stack memory and the heap memory
- use of a buffer

### Fillit
A variant of the game Tetris. It's a program that takes a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible, preferably in the least amount of time.
key point learned:
- efficient structure of data: use of struct and linked lists
- backtracking : an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying multiple options to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those options as soon as they fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem

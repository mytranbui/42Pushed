## Piscine Reloaded
A serie of exercises done during the piscine to remind you all the basics of the C programming language.

## Get_next_line
A function that reads a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor.

key points learned:
- **static variables**
- deeper understanding of allocations, what is happening in the **stack** memory and the **heap** memory
- use of a **buffer**

## Libft
Create your own library of functions

key points learned:
- **Makefile**
- a **header** file
- importance of protecting allocated memory 

## Fillit
A variant of the game Tetris. It's a program that takes a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible, preferably in the least amount of time.

key point learned:
- efficient structure of data: use of **struct** and **linked lists**
- **backtracking** : an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying multiple options to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those options as soon as they fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem

## FDF
The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping.  Forexample, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is aprerequisite condition to its conquest. As another example, comparing various 3D repre-sentations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand thesephenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared.
This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french,hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points(x, y, z)via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed asa parameter to your program

key points learned:
- basics of **graphic programming**: place points in space, join points with segments, observe a scene at any viewpoint
- dealing events: open/close a window, mouse click/scroll, keyboard, etc.

## Init
A serie of exercises to introduce you to system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of  scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

## Ft_printf
Recreate the function printf

## Filler
Create a player to fight other students on the Filler board. The concept is simple: two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other, the game piece obtained by the game master (in the form of an executable Ruby program).The game ends when the game piece cannot be placed anymore.
Filler is an algorithmic game which consists in filling a grid of a known size in advance with pieces of random size and shapes, without the pieces being stacked more than onesquare above each other and without them exceeding the grid. If one of these conditions is not met, the game stops.
